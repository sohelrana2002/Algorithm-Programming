# ðŸ§  Algorithm Programming

Welcome to my **Algorithm Programming** repository!  
This repo contains all my **C++ algorithm codes, lab reports, and problem-solving exercises** from my Computer Science coursework.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Repository
This repository is a collection of programs and lab tasks written in **C++**.  
Each folder represents a specific **lab report**, **assessment**, or **problem-solving topic**.

The main goal is to **practice, understand, and implement core algorithm concepts** such as:
- Searching and Sorting
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Techniques
- And many other algorithmic problem-solving approaches
